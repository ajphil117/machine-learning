# Machine Learning Projects
These projects provided a comprehensive study of multiple Machine Learning techniques over the course of 12 weeks using Python in Google Colab.

Individually I completed multiple tasks that improved my understanding of machine learning; these tasks included exploration into regression (linear, Ridge, and LASSO), classification (K-Nearest Neighbours, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines), training and adapting deep networks, person re-identification using both non-deep and deep learning, clusters, and multi-task learning.

In the group, I was then able to further develop my skills in classification techniques as we were tasked to classify the text of Enron email data (containing approximately 500,000 emails for 150 users) to decide to send it.

The sections of each project is outlined in further detail below.

## Project Sections
### 1A: Regression and Classification
This section of the project was completed individually.

Linear, Ridge, and LASSO regression models were explored to predict the number of violent crimes per capita from the socio-economic data provided.

K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Random Forest, and an ensemble of Support Vector Machines (SVM) classification methods were used to classify land type from spectral data.

### 1B: Deep Networks and Person Re-Identification
This section of the project was completed individually.

A Linear One vs One Standard Vector Machine (with C = 1) and a DCNN architecture was designed/selected by (a) training a model from scratch using no data augmentation and (b)  training a model from scratch using the data augmentation method of my choice on the provided training set.

Non-deep learning methods using Principal Component Analysis into Linear Discriminate Analysis and Siamese Networks were used for Person Re-Identification.

### 1C: Clustering and Multi-Task Learning
This section of the project was completed individually.

KMeans and Gaussian Mixture Modelling (GMM) methods were explored to cluster movies and their ratings.

A DCNN architecture was used to classify traits of people within the data (e.g. gender, torso clothing colour, etc.).

### 2: Enron Email Classification
This project was completed with a team, 3 members.

K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with Support Vector Machines (SVM) methods were used to classify classify the text of an email within the provided Enron Email dataset to predict who sent it.
